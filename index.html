            <h4><mark> About</mark></h4>
            <p>
              This was the final project of the Open and User Innovation course (ME1033), at KTH.
              We were asked to write an essay about any topic of our preference, related to Open and User Innovation.
              I am very interested in Entrepeneurship for Social Impact, therefore, I chose to write about how Open Innovation can be used for a improving the lives of those in need.
              The essay I wrote starts witha brief secondary research about Open Innovation, then it explores the different of Social Innovation strategies.
              I conclude with a presentation of the OpenIDEO project and the reasons that allowed it to be a case of success.
              My goal with this essay was to highlight the need for more solutions for current social issuesand and to invite the reader to reflect about it.
            </p>
            <h4><mark> Abstract </mark></h4>
            <p>
              This paper describes examples of Social Innovation projects currently making positive impact in society by giving individuals the support and tools needed for them to create solutions by themselves.
              Such projects might vary in strategy and focus, however, they were all built to help individuals on the tasks of finding information, learning technical skills and getting in contact with partners.
              By empowering the users, it is possible to achieve a much greater and broader impact than by relying on single leaders or big corporations.
              We believe this paper can add much value to the community, by showing how it is possible to combine Open and User Innovation with Social Impact.

            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>
              This group project was part of the Business Development lab (ME2073) at KTH.
              Among our partners, we had support from Herman's, Syster o Bror, Sophies Canelé, Café Ruben, Symbios, Sopköket, Trädgårdscafé and Lunchcube.
              After the course, we started negotiations with ResQ Club to handover the business.
              We went beyond the requirements when after four months of work we actually <mark>launched the product</mark>.
            </p>
            <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
              We wanted to create a sustainable solution for the big problem of food waste.
              Our idea was a marketplace for restaurants to advertise meal deals right before closing time.
              My team was very ambitious, as they wanted to target customers all over Stockholm, but my opinion was that we should <mark>start small</mark>, test it then iterate.
              So we decided to focus on university students and the restaurants around campus.
              We had weekly meetings <b>(Figure 1) </b>and my role in the team was to <mark>update the business model</mark> canvas after them.
              During user research I was also responsible for interviewing students to gather data to validate our idea.
              Whilst the team was developing the prototype, I managed the Facebook page and I created a marketing campaign <b>(Figure 2) </b>around a launch event.
              I was the one planning and <mark>organising the event</mark> so I had to contact partners, invite people and advertise it to teh students.
              In the end we had more than 200 people attending it and it was a great success <b>(Figure 3)</b>.
              After launching, the app was running with special offers for one month at <mark>Herman's</mark>, a famous vegetarian restaurant in Stockholm.
            </p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
          <p>
            It is not easy to start a business from scratch, but I learned a lot about how to <mark>create traction</mark> around an idea.
            The marketing campaign that led to the launch event was a great success and it taught me the power <mark>social media</mark> on advertising a product.
            We received a lot of positive feedback on both our process and our idea.
            I believe this is because we developed something based on user research, for a real need and we targeted a very <mark>specific user group</mark>.
            The combination of these factors helped the proposition to be stronger.
            I can say that feel much more prepared to create a business on my own after this experience.

              <h4>About</h4>
              <p>This Summer I joined the Digital Cities Summer School <b>(Figure 1)</b> organized by EIT Digital during two weeks.
                We had many guest lectures <b>(Figure 2)</b> and a business challenge to work with.
                My brief was the “Call for innovation to enhance Paris’ candidacy: SMART PARIS 2024", proposed by the Committee for Paris Olympics Candidacy.
                The goal was to find ways of capitalizing on this event, to make the city smarter and to leave a positive legacy.
                The case provider highlighted the issues of minimizing the ecological footprint.
              </p>
              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
                The first step I took was understanding the problem thoroughly.
                I read the brief, I searched for more examples on the website and I discussed with the group in the end.
                We brainstormed a list of problems related to the Olympics and we all wrote our to it.
                Some of my ideas were a bracelet for cashless purchases during the games, a energy generator embedded in bikes and using recycling to collect points.
                The group decided to go for this last one.
                To work more efficiently, we divided tasks.
                I was responsible for <mark>managing the team</mark>, so I had to keep track of to do list and ask for progress every day.
                I was also working on the <mark>business model canvas</mark> and iterating it according to our new insights.
                I read a lot about <mark>financial forecast</mark> calculation to help my colleague who was responsible for this part, which made me learn more about it.
                I created the visual identity for the pitch and I assigned slides to the other team members.
                In the end I wrote the motivation part of the <mark>business plan report</mark>, a summary about the whole ideation process and some details of the canvas.
              </p>
              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>
                The deliverables for the Summer Course were a report, two pitches and a business plan.
                Our business idea comes from the need to give citizens more incentives to recycle and to help them to separate the trash.
                We propose the installation of smart trash bins, adding to it a gamification system to award points to the users, to be later exchanged for discounts during the Olympics games.
                My main concern was that this solution requires an initial investment by city government, however, after working on the financial forecast, it turns out to be very profitable in the long term.
                Another issue I raised during our group discussions was on the feasibility of developing smart bins, but secondary research showed that there are already technology to create that.
                It was a great opportunity to practice what I learned on the Entrepreneurship course I had at university and I learned a lot about managing a team.

              <h4>About</h4>
              <p>
                With this project we were one of the winners of the Green Hackathon Smart Cities, Stockholm (12-13th Feb 2016).
                The challenge was to design a solution for the problem of caretakers having to drive themselves to the regular visits to the elderly people in Sweden.
                We had two days and a group of five members to pitch a feasible and sustainable way to improve the current system.
              </p>
              <div>
              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
                We had a short time to work on an idea that could prove its value to the judges and to the society.
                Since the beginning, I suggested that our best approach would be to focus on simplicity and feasibility of the solution.
                 We <mark>brainstormed</mark> about the current caretaker issues <b>(Figure 1)</b>so that we could choose one pain point to target.
                 Once we agreed with an idea, we divided tasks and I was responsible for <mark>collecting data</mark> that motivates the need for our proposal.
                 I had to research many government report to scrap data about the elderly population to help calculating the distance driven by the caretakers everyday.
                 In the end, I also implemented a visualization using the <mark>C3 library of d3.js</mark> to show how the cost of elderly care has been increasing in Sweden.
                 The data and the visualization were used on the <mark>pitch</mark> we prepared as a group <b>(Figure 2)</b>.

              </p>
            </div>
              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p>
                We needed to reduce the mileage caretakers drove by car every day, without affecting the quality of care for the elderly.
                 So we designed a solution for caretakers could share rides, preserving quality indicators and following their schedule.
                 Since it was a two days hackathon, I learned a lot about working efficiently under <mark>time pressure</mark>.
                 It also made me realise that I am already capable of applying what I am learning at university to tackle real and important problems.
                 Overall, I really enjoyed giving my time and skills for an idea that I believe can have a <mark>positive impact</mark> in society.
                 We <mark>won first prize</mark> in our category <b>(Figure 3)</b>, because besides improving the sustainability of big cities, our solution did not demand many resources to be implemented.
                 We were invited by <mark>Scania</mark> to work with them for Summer internship in Stockholm.

                    <p>This Summer I joined the workshop "Adventures in Data Visualization" at SUPSI, Lugano, Switzerland.
                    The workshop was an intensive three days course with tutoring sessions from experienced professionals <b>(Figure 1)</b> and a group project.
                    In this year edition, we were asked to explore <mark>Open Data</mark> datasets from Swiss organizations.
                    We had to select, analyse and manipulate the data in order to transform it in a narrative flow and create an interactive experience.</p>

                    <p>I proposed a division in the team <b>(Figure 2) </b>so we could be more productive.
                      Therefore, we had one member developing the d3.js, one doing the front-end, and another one responsible for wireframing.
                      Most of the time I was peer coding in the <mark>front-end</mark>, because I wanted to learn more about <mark>Bootstrap</mark> and my team member was very good at it.
                      I was doing some of the UX design too, I created <mark>sketches</mark> for the website flow and I chose the colour scheme.
                      <mark>I had the idea of creating a quiz</mark>, asking users to guess the language of a quote, so I had to choose funny quotes and to create the interaction flow.
                      I also manipulated a lot of data.
                      I had to clean and re organize the tables that we found on the Open Data Swiss, because some of its data was not relevant for our project.
                      I used <mark>Excel</mark> for that, because the task did not require a more complex approach.
                      In the end, I did the <mark>usability and functionality test </mark>of the prototype and I passed the issues to my developer colleague.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Results</h4>
                    <p>
                      We called our project "an exploration into the linguistic immigration flows of Switzerland".
                      It displays the many languages spoken by the immigrants who arrived in Switzerland in 2014.
                      By using the metaphor of colourful particles we wanted to express their diversity and the quiz was designed to engage more the users.
                      We exposed it at the Master Fair <b>(Figure 3)</b> at SUPSI Lugano, among the thesis projects there.
                      We also received an invitation from http://muda.co/zurich/ to have our project <mark>exhihited in Zurich</mark> this Fall.

            <h4><mark> Context</mark></h4>
            <p>I worked with a team for the ACM CHI 2016 Student Competition. As the theme of this year's edition was related to assistive techologies, we were designign for stroke patients.
            This project consisted of a protoype, a video and a paper. Based on this experience, I wrote a short paper too, focusing on the challenges and possible guidelines for other designers willing to work for the same group of users.
            This paper was not for CHI Student Competition, but rather for the Research Seminars course (DH2632) at KTH.</p>

            <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
            <p>I was working individually for this paper. The focus was on what I have learned during the design process of a game for stroke patients.
            I described my experiences as well as the challenges I had to face in order to engage more the patients on evaluation.
            I did not very deep on literature review, as I wanted to report my own experience this time.</p>

            <h4><mark> Abstract</mark></h4>
            <p>The motor and speech impairments of many stroke patients make interacting with screen interfaces a challenging activ- ity.
            Consequently, they might be excluded of the possibilities of social contact and entertainment provided by technology.
            Inspired by the movie ”The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”, in which a man has his life completely changed after losing all body movementswe designed ”The Tavern”.
            Our goal was to help them by giving new interactive ways to enjoy positive social experiences during their recovery, however we faced many challenges, as described on this paper.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>This paper is the project I did for my Bachelor Thesis, which got a distinction.
            It investigated Attribution of Responsibility and Sense of Agency using a game I designed and implemented using Unity.
            The project was made in collaboration with Prof. Pim Haselager and Prof. Louis Vuurpijl at Radboud Universitet, Nijmegen, Netherlands. In Brazil, my supervisor was Prof. Andre Campos.
            This paper was <mark>published and presented</mark> at the SBGames Brazil 2014. </p>

            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>This was a project I did most on my own: I was responsible for proposing the research questions, doing the <mark>literature review</mark>, designing the game, analysing the results statistically and write the final paper.
            My research interest was on how users perceived sharing control with an Artificial Intelligent (AI) agent. I came up with the idea of using a game so that we could engage more participants and the task would not be burden for them.
            Then, I designed the commands to be partially under user control and partially under influence of an AI agents. I wanted to observe the behaviour of the users in the case they lose the game and who they would blame for that.
            I coded the game in <mark>C#</mark> and I used the rendering engine <mark>Unity</mark>. I also <mark>designed a website</mark> <b>(Figure 1)</b> that included the game and the questionnaire <b>(Figure 2)</b> for my research.
            The experiment was designed to be fun, intuitive and easy to complete, so that even users were not required any prior knowledge to play it.
            After collecting data from the experiment I used minitab to conduct the <mark>inferential statistical</mark> tests.
            </p>

            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>Once I finished with the analysis I wrote the thesis and a paper, which I submitted it to SBGames 2014.
              As it got accepted <b>(Figure 3)</b> I had to present my work in the conference to an audience of around 100 people. I also had to give the <mark>presentation in English</mark>.
              I got a <mark>distinction mark</mark> for this project for my Bachelor Thesis as well.

          <h4><mark> About</mark></h4>
            <p>This was the final report for the Research Methodology course (II2202) at KTH.
            We were asked to use research methods to investigate a research question, related to Human Computer Interaction.
            Me and my partner were interested in discovering how they can influence the user experience.
            We were allowed to use made up data, as long as we had a complete report.
          </p>


          <h4><mark> Abstract</mark></h4>
            <p>This project investigated how colours can influence the user experience whenever they are navigating on a website, specially for understanding information and answering personal questions.
            An online experiment was conducted with 72 subjects in order to measure time spent to understand the main idea of a paragraph and the number of words written for a personal question.
            The results showed that the majority of subjects were influenced in the same way by the same colour (which means that the differences between background colours were significant).
            Therefore, we interpreted these results as an indication that the background colour can play a relevant role in fostering the user experience.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>Solid was the final project for the course of Information Visualization (DH2321) at KTH <b>(Figure 1)</b>.
              We were given total freedom on technology, dataset and theme we wanted to explore.
              The goal was to create a visualization to help users to see, to understand and to create their own discussions about a particular topic.</p>

              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
                I was part of all the brainstorming sessions in which we explored different ideas and themes.
                My main contribution to it was pointing out how to create a narrative out of the data, instead of merely plotting it to a visual representation.
                Our team organised itself in three tasks: webpage design, scraping data and coding the visualization.
                I was responsible for bringing <mark>user centred design</mark> approaches to the project, so I created simplified personas of possible users to target, with their goals and needs.
                Then, I wrote scenarios based on the data visualization framework of <mark>"overview, zoom, filter, details on demand"</mark>.
                I also did some secondary research on similar projects to both help us to create something new and to serve as inspiration.
                My main responsibility after that was to code the data visualization. At first, the designers wanted to use a Treemap, but after I implemented it, I found out that this visual structure was not representing the data in the correct way.
                After some discussion, me and the designers decided to use a Sunburst <b>(Figure 2)</b> instead. I coded it using <mark>d3.js</mark> and the legend using d3-legend.js.
                For the legend, I created a log scale so that the colours could be better distributed and the differences between nodes would look clearer.
                Finally, I used the <mark>Wikipedia API</mark> to add a description box when the user clicked on a node of the Sunburst.
              </p>
              <h4>Results</h4>
              <p> We created Solid for data journalists and curious people, to help them to discover interesting stories that the media might not give much attention to.
                We combined two data sets to display loss in quality of life due to avoidable causes (DALYs) in comparison with what media covers.
                With this project we won three categories at <mark>C-Awards</mark> in Stockholm <b>(Figure 3)</b>: best Business Opportunity, Best Progress in Science and Best by Popular Vote.
                We recently got contacted by <mark>Gapminder</mark> for a collaboration on their project about the same topic.

            <h4><mark> Context</mark></h4>
            <p>This was one of the individual projects for the course of Information Visualization (DH2321) at KTH.
              We were asked to create a visualization to improve the tool from World Values Survey (WVS) by overcoming some of its limitations and combining it with data from Gapminder.
              We should focus on one question from the dataset and build a visualization that would answer that. </p>

              <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>I first made an analysis of the current visualization tool from World Values Survey (WVS).
              I considered the question of how how the Feeling of Hapiness is related to the importance people give to Religion, Politics, Family, among other factors.
              I found out that the visualization with WVS was not straight foward as well as the comparision between continents.
              Based on this result I started the design of the another tool.
              I created sketches and I researched the d3.js library for a visual structure compatible with my vision.
              I chose Paralel Coordinates, as it covered the exact flaws from the WVS I wanted to improve.
            </p>
              <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
              The visualization I implemented consisted in a short Analytical Trail of the WVS tool followed by Paralel Coordinates.
              I selected 5 countries from different continents, one colour for each, so that the user could see the comparision between them.
              I think the final result allowed a clearer overwien of how the Happiness Factors differ between countries and between each other.
              An ideal tool could also include the comparision of periods of time, but I did not implement it for this version.

            <h4><mark> Context</mark></h4>
            <p>This was the first individual project for the course of Information Visualization (DH2321) at KTH.
              The professor collected data about our skills and we were asked to design a good visualization tool for this data.
              We were given complete freedom to choose the technology and visual structure we would like to use. </p>

              <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>I was not familiar with d3.js or any other data-driven visualization library.
                Also, I wanted to be able to explain my idea through a presentation, therefore I chose Prezi to build a protoype and combine it with legend and text.
                I enviosed the outcome as some sort of catalogue, that could allow a quick and intuitive comparision between the students.
              </p>
              <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
              A student was represented by a strip. The strip had visual characteristics depedning on the skills of a student.
              Each skill was represented as a square. The sqaures were put side by side to form the strip.
              The larger the square, the higher a student rated that skill, thus the longer the strip, the "stronger" the student in general.
              It was easy to spot users with a determined skill because each skill had a specific colour.
              Interests and expectations were represnted in text form.
              The protoype looked much like a DNA, which was not intended but ended up being the main metaphor.

              This was the first project of the Interactive Programming course (DH2642) at KTH.
              We were asked to make an interactive prototype for a mobile application of a dineer planner.
              It was intended to be just a draft version of it, given that we were going to implement another one during the course.
            </p>

              <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>
                We brainstormed the different possibilities for dinner planner, as it can created with many users in mind.
                After the discussion, me and my teammate we decided to design for students planning a budget meal.
                Therefore, we wanted to highlight the feature of prize and build the whole concept around it.
                We created pen and pencil sketches of the user flow and interface before we moved to the collaborative UxPin online tool.
              </p>
              <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
                We created a user case to demonstrate our concept of budget dinner planner.
                The prototype is interactive as it was built with UxPin.
                We tested the idea with other classmates by asking them to Think-Aloud so that we could spot the flaws of it.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>This project was part of the coursework for the Methodology of Interaction Design (IC2005) course at KTH.
              Our task was to follow the brief to the CHI 2016 on <mark>Assistive Technology</mark>.
              After four weeks of work, we came up with a social game to be played by stroke patients in recover either in the hospital or at home. </p>
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>Our design process was divided in four phases, one per week: brainstorming, building personas and scenarios, creating sketches and prototypes, and finally evaluation.
            We wanted to work with recovering stroke patients, we had some brainstorming sessions. I proposed to the group that we could try out new methods, so we used Six Thinking Hats and <mark>bodystorming</mark> in the hospital.
            For data collection, I did secondary research on previous papers. I also created a survey to be posted at an online forum.
            I also did one semi-structured interviews with a medical experts.
            Using the data collected I built <mark>personas and scenarios</mark> to illustrate a situation when our personas would use our device.
            Based on this, I created a sketch <b>(Figure 1)</b> with my colleague on the interaction flow so that we could use for building the prototype.
            With her help, I created a <mark>hi-fi prototype</mark> using PowerPoint <b>(Figure 2)</b>.
            Then, we went to a hospital to test it with a nurse specialized on stroke <b>(Figure 3)</b>.
            I did a <mark>semi-structured interview</mark> with her, focusing on the issues that could arise for the patients using our prototype.
            Afterwards, I tested the usability of the prototype using the <mark>Think Aloud</mark> method.
            In the end, I wrote a paper to be submitted to CHI 2016 and my group did a video and a poster.
          </p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>For the <mark>CHI 2016 Design Competition</mark> we had to deliver a paper, a poster and a video.
               In the paper, I described previous works, our design process and the outcomes of the evaluation.
               Even though our focus was on recovering patients, not the vulnerable ones, this project showed me it is <mark>extremely challenging to design for patients</mark>.
               The main issue is that it is hard to get permission for direct access to them.
               For this reason we had to collect data either from remote users or from experts, which did not give us many insights.
               As a result, we did not win the competition, however, I have learned a lot about subimiting a paper to an important conference and I am trying again with another project this year.

            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>This was my <mark>first Interaction Design project</mark>, where I learned the basics of the process.
              It was part of the coursework for the Human-computer Interaction: Principles and Design (IC1007) course at KTH.
              I was working in a group and we were given the task of researching the needs of personal trainers, then designing an interactive, screen-based prototype.

            </p>
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>In order to identify the needs of personal trainers, I did some <mark>secondary research</mark> and I created the questions for a <mark>semi-structured interview</mark> at the university gym <b>(Figure 1)</b>.
              Based on the findings we had a <mark>brainstorming session</mark> and I was responsible for <mark>sketching</mark> a solution for the problem of advertising personal trainer services.
              I came up with the idea of an app inspired by Tinder, in which users could "match" with their preferred personal trainers.
              I also made a <mark>paper prototype</mark> (low fidelity) to communicate my ideas.
              After discussing, we as a group decided to focus on another idea they have designed: gamification app for keeping track of the progress of personal trainer's clients.
            Then, I collaborated on building a <mark>high fidelity prototype</mark> using PowerPoint.
            Me and another colleague took this prototype to the field and we tested it <b>(Figure 3)</b> using the Think Aloud method, followed by an <mark>open interview</mark>. I was the moderator and he was recording it.
            From this tests I found that many aspects of the design were not clear to the user and I worked with the team on a report with suggestions to improve the interface. </p>
            <h4>Results</h4>
            <p>It was the first time I went through the design process as a whole.
              Even though our users were previously defined to us in the brief, I have learned how to sketch solutions, create paper prototypes and test them with real users.
              I have learned lessons that I will carry to future projects, such as the importance of planning the evaluation session, the impact the tools can have on design and that we need to practice the methods to become better at them.
              In the end, as a designer, <mark>I am not my own user</mark>, so I need to reach out to the people so that I can create products they appreciate.

                                    And I would love to hear it from you: an honest feedback, an inivitation for collaboration, an unexpected question, a job vacancy or just to say hi.<br><br>

            <h4><mark> About</mark></h4>
            <p>
              This was the final project of the Open and User Innovation course (ME1033), at KTH.
              We were asked to write an essay about any topic of our preference, related to Open and User Innovation.
              I am very interested in Entrepeneurship for Social Impact, therefore, I chose to write about how Open Innovation can be used for a improving the lives of those in need.
              The essay I wrote starts witha brief secondary research about Open Innovation, then it explores the different of Social Innovation strategies.
              I conclude with a presentation of the OpenIDEO project and the reasons that allowed it to be a case of success.
              My goal with this essay was to highlight the need for more solutions for current social issuesand and to invite the reader to reflect about it.
            </p>
            <h4><mark> Abstract </mark></h4>
            <p>
              This paper describes examples of Social Innovation projects currently making positive impact in society by giving individuals the support and tools needed for them to create solutions by themselves.
              Such projects might vary in strategy and focus, however, they were all built to help individuals on the tasks of finding information, learning technical skills and getting in contact with partners.
              By empowering the users, it is possible to achieve a much greater and broader impact than by relying on single leaders or big corporations.
              We believe this paper can add much value to the community, by showing how it is possible to combine Open and User Innovation with Social Impact.

            <p>
              This project was part of the Business Development lab (ME2073) at KTH.
              The Business Development lab is concentrated on project work throughtout phased of Business Plan creation.
              I worked in a team of seven members and we developed the idea in four months.
            </p>
            <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>We started with problem recognition and surveys with potential users.
              As we wanted to create a a sustainable solution for the big problem of food waste, we had the idea of a marketplace for restaurants to advertise meal deals right before closing time.
              Our main value proposition was that it could helps on decreasing the food waste at the same time it provides good quality and affordable options to customers.
            </p>
            <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
          <p>It started as a group project, however, we went beyond the requirements when we actually launched the product at Stockholm University.
            We developed the web service and we promoted it in a picnic event with 200 people. The food we provided was from many restaurant in Stockholm, they gave us free samples for our event.
            Later on, we made a deal with Herman's, a famous vegetarian restaurant, and our marketplace was running for around one month.
            At the end of the course, we sold this project to a Swedish start up, because our group was going to study in different universities.

              <h4><mark> Context</mark></h4>
              <p>This Summer I was participating in the Digital Cities Summer School organized by EIT Digital during two weeks.
                The challenge selected by my group (five members) was the “Call for innovation to enhance Paris’ candidacy: SMART PARIS 2024", proposed by the Committee for Paris Olympics Candidacy.
                The goal was to find ways of capitalizing on this event, to make the city smarter and to leave a positive legacy.
                The case provider highlighted the issues of minimizing the ecological footprint, improving the energy efficiency and increasing the accessibility and atmosphere within the city.
              </p>

              <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>
                The first step we took was understanding the problem thoroughly.
                We read the case, we saw the examples on the website and we discussed with other classmates.
                The brainstorming seesion began with a list of problems related to the Olypimcs.
                Then, each of us gave several ideas related to these problems. Afterwards, we voted to decide on what to focus on.
                To work more efficiently, the members received goals, depending on their expertise, or what they would like to improve.
                I was responsible for management, business model canvas, report writing, standardize the pitch and research.
                In the end, we presented it for a board of experts who gave us feedback on the idea.
              </p>
              <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
              <p>
                The delivarables for the Summer Course were a report, two pitches and a complete business.
                We also created the conceptual design of the User Interface.
                Recyclove, our business idea, comes from the need to give citizens more incentives to recycle and to help them to separate the trash.
                We propose the installation and maintenance of smart trash bins around the city, topping it up with a gamification system to award points to the users.
                People would be able to later on use the points to exchange for tickets and discounts vouchers.
                Although such solution requires an initial investment by city government, in long term they can save a lot more.

              <h4><mark> Context</mark></h4>
              <p>
                With this project we were one of the winners of the Green Hackathon Smart Cities, Stockholm (12-13th Feb 2016).
                The challenge was to find a solution for the problem of elderly care in Sweden.
                Currently, the care takers need to drive themselves to the different houses where they work.
                We had two days and a group of five members to pitch a feasible and sustainable way to improve the elderly care.
              </p>
              <div>
              <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>
                We had a short time to work on an idea that could prove its value to the judges and to the society.
                We realized that in our case, the best way to solve this problem would be to focus on simplicity and be straigh forward.
                It was only after an extensive analysis of the current problems care takers face, that we started propsing solutions and grouping them.
                Our brainsstroming session lasted the whole evening but in the end we were convinced that we had a good point to start with.
                The next day we focused on creating a excellent picth, designing user interface and researching market trends.
              </p>
            </div>
              <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
              <p>
                We needed to reduce the mileage care takers drove by car every day, without affecting the quality of care for the elderly.
                We were inspired by Uber and Lyft when we came up with the concept of Drive Care.
                Caretakers could share rides, with a professional driver that would ride caregivers to destination and pick them up to next place.
                Route optimization algorithm would decide the best routes, preserving quality indicators and following the care takers schedule.
                The sustainbale benefits are less pollution and time spent on traffic jams.
                This solution won first prze in our category and we were invited to implement it at Scania office in Stockholm.

                    <p>This Summer I joined the workshop "Adventures in Data Visualization" at SUPSI, Lugano, Switzerland.
                    The workshop was an intensive three days course with tutoring sessions and a practical task to be developed in groups.
                    In this year edition, we were asked to explore Open Data datasets form Swiss organizations.
                    We had to access, analyse and manpulate the data in order to transform it in a narrative flow and create an interactive experience.</p>

                    <h4><mark> Process </mark></mark></h4>
                    <p>
                      The group formation took into account our strongest skills so that we could have a balanced team.
                      My team had one member developing the d3.js, another one doing the front-end, a girl was responsible for the ux design
                      and I was on the design part, but I also manipulaed a lot of data.
                      I had to clean and re organize the tables that we found on the Open Data Swiss.

                      We called our project "an exploration into the linguistic immigration flows of Switzerland".
                      It displays the many languages spoken by the immigrants who arrived in Switzerland in 2014.
                      By using the metaphor of colourful particles we wanted to express their diversity.
                      The user interacts with the visualization through an informative quiz.

            <h4><mark> Context</mark></h4>
            <p>I worked with a team for the ACM CHI 2016 Student Competition. As the theme of this year's edition was related to assistive techologies, we were designign for stroke patients.
            This project consisted of a protoype, a video and a paper. Based on this experience, I wrote a short paper too, focusing on the challenges and possible guidelines for other designers willing to work for the same group of users.
            This paper was not for CHI Student Competition, but rather for the Research Seminars course (DH2632) at KTH.</p>

            <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
            <p>I was working individually for this paper. The focus was on what I have learned during the design process of a game for stroke patients.
            I described my experiences as well as the challenges I had to face in order to engage more the patients on evaluation.
            I did not very deep on literature review, as I wanted to report my own experience this time.</p>

            <h4><mark> Abstract</mark></h4>
            <p>The motor and speech impairments of many stroke patients make interacting with screen interfaces a challenging activ- ity.
            Consequently, they might be excluded of the possibilities of social contact and entertainment provided by technology.
            Inspired by the movie ”The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”, in which a man has his life completely changed after losing all body movementswe designed ”The Tavern”.
            Our goal was to help them by giving new interactive ways to enjoy positive social experiences during their recovery, however we faced many challenges, as described on this paper.

            <h4><mark> About</mark></h4>
            <p>This paper is a project I did for the Bachelor Thesis I wrote when compelting my degree in Computer Science.
            The topic tested Attribution of Responsibility and Sense of Agency using a game I designed and implemented using Unity.
            This paper was published and presented at the SBGames Brazil 2014. </p>

            <h4><mark> Abstract</mark></h4>
          <p> Attribution of responsibility and sense of agency are key topics raised by situations in which control is shared between man and machine.
            For example, when a failure occurs in a robotic surgery, causing permanent injuries to a patient, who should be blamed?
            In order to investigate how individuals attribute responsibility and how they perceive agency, a game was used as a playful research tool.
            The assumption is that a game may lead the player to behave more naturally, forgetting he is in a conducted experiment.
            This paper presents the Shared Ball game, designed to simulate a situation of shared control.
            It was hypothesised that users would display a self servicing bias behaviour when playing the game.
            After conducting an experiment, the hypothesis showed to be consistent.
            Knowledge acquired in this experiment can be beneficial to the construction of safer and more enjoyable technology, since that all possible abnormal conditions can never be fully predicted.
            The use of adaptive and autonomous technology has to be accompanied by a debate on moral responsibility and ethical rules.

            <p>This was the final report for the Research Methodology course (II2202) at KTH.
            We were asked to use research methods to investigate a research question, related to Human Computer Interaction.
            Me and my partner were interested in discovering how they can influence the user experience.
            We were allowed to use made up data, as long as we had a complete report.
          </p>


          <h4><mark> Abstract</mark></h4>
            <p>This project investigated how colours can influence the user experience whenever they are navigating on a website, specially for understanding information and answering personal questions.
            An online experiment was conducted with 72 subjects in order to measure time spent to understand the main idea of a paragraph and the number of words written for a personal question.
            The results showed that the majority of subjects were influenced in the same way by the same colour (which means that the differences between background colours were significant).
            Therefore, we interpreted these results as an indication that the background colour can play a relevant role in fostering the user experience.

            <p>Solid was the final project for the course of Information Visualization (DH2321) at KTH.
              We were given total freedom on technology, dataset and theme we wanted to explore.
              The goal was to create a visualization to help users to see, to understand and to create their own discussions about a particular topic.</p>

              <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>Given that the scope was really broad, we needed three brainstorming sessions until we chose an idea to work with.
                The team consisted of nine Master students and we organised ourselves in smaller teams: design, data and coding.
                I was responsible for coding the d3.js visualization.
              </p>
              <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
          <p>  We created Solid with datajournalists in mind, to help them to discover interesting stories that the media might not give much attention to.
            We combined two datasets to display the loss of disability-lost-life-years (DALYs) in comparison with what media covers.
            DALYs do not represent death, but loss in quality of life due to avoidable causes.
            This visualisation aims at showing the impact of DALYS around the world and it is commit to a transparent overview of the media coverage.

            <p>This was one of the individual projects for the course of Information Visualization (DH2321) at KTH.
              We were asked to create a visualization to improve the tool from World Values Survey (WVS) by overcoming some of its limitations and combining it with data from Gapminder.
              We should focus on one question from the dataset and build a visualization that would answer that. </p>

              <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>I first made an analysis of the current visualization tool from World Values Survey (WVS).
              I considered the question of how how the Feeling of Hapiness is related to the importance people give to Religion, Politics, Family, among other factors.
              I found out that the visualization with WVS was not straight foward as well as the comparision between continents.
              Based on this result I started the design of the another tool.
              I created sketches and I researched the d3.js library for a visual structure compatible with my vision.
              I chose Paralel Coordinates, as it covered the exact flaws from the WVS I wanted to improve.
            </p>
              <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
              The visualization I implemented consisted in a short Analytical Trail of the WVS tool followed by Paralel Coordinates.
              I selected 5 countries from different continents, one colour for each, so that the user could see the comparision between them.
              I think the final result allowed a clearer overwien of how the Happiness Factors differ between countries and between each other.
              An ideal tool could also include the comparision of periods of time, but I did not implement it for this version.

              The professor collected data about our skills and we were asked to design a good visualization tool for this data.
              We were given complete freedom to choose the technology and visual structure we would like to use. </p>

              <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>I was not familiar with d3.js or any other data-driven visualization library.
                Also, I wanted to be able to explain my idea through a presentation, therefore I chose Prezi to build a protoype and combine it with legend and text.
                I enviosed the outcome as some sort of catalogue, that could allow a quick and intuitive comparision between the students.
              </p>
              <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
              A student was represented by a strip. The strip had visual characteristics depedning on the skills of a student.
              Each skill was represented as a square. The sqaures were put side by side to form the strip.
              The larger the square, the higher a student rated that skill, thus the longer the strip, the "stronger" the student in general.
              It was easy to spot users with a determined skill because each skill had a specific colour.
              Interests and expectations were represnted in text form.
              The protoype looked much like a DNA, which was not intended but ended up being the main metaphor.

              This was the first project of the Interactive Programming course (DH2642) at KTH.
              We were asked to make an interactive prototype for a mobile application of a dineer planner.
              It was intended to be just a draft version of it, given that we were going to implement another one during the course.
            </p>

              <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
              <p>
                We brainstormed the different possibilities for dinner planner, as it can created with many users in mind.
                After the discussion, me and my teammate we decided to design for students planning a budget meal.
                Therefore, we wanted to highlight the feature of prize and build the whole concept around it.
                We created pen and pencil sketches of the user flow and interface before we moved to the collaborative UxPin online tool.
              </p>
              <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
                We created a user case to demonstrate our concept of budget dinner planner.
                The prototype is interactive as it was built with UxPin.
                We tested the idea with other classmates by asking them to Think-Aloud so that we could spot the flaws of it.

            <h4><mark> Context</mark></h4>
            <p>This project was part of the coursework for the Methodology of Interaction Design (IC2005) course at KTH. My group consisted of me and two other classmates. Our task was to follow the brief to the CHI 2016 on Assistive Technology: “design interventions to serve users that present different and often challenging needs”. After four weeks of work, we came up with a social game to be played by stroke patients in recover either in the hospital or at home. </p>
            <h4><mark> Abstract</mark></h4>
            <p>The motor and speech impairments of many stroke patients makes them excluded of the possibilities of social contact and entertainment provided by technology. We designed ”The Tavern” as screen interface controlled by speech or gesture, where patients can talk with each other and play games together, the way it was in taverns and traditional bars. Our goal was to help them by giving new interactive ways to enjoy positive social experiences during their recovery. </p>
            <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
            <p>Our design process was divided in four phases, one phase per week: brainstorming, building personas and scenarios, creating sketches and prototypes, and finally evaluating a prototype. </p>
            <p>As we were inspired by the movie “The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”, we wanted to work with recovering stroke patients. We had some brainstorming sessions, using the the traditional method, the Six Thinking Hats method and the bodystorming in the hospital. Then, we collected data from second research, surveys on online communities, semi-structured interviews with experts and relatives.</p>
            <p>Using the data collected we built two personas, Frank and Hiltrude, being Hiltrude the secondary one. Then, besides the persona, we also developed a scenario [5] to illustrate a situation when Frank would use our device. Based on the data analysis, personas and scenarios of the previous phase we developed sketches, and later on an interactive prototype to be used for evaluation. </p>
            <p>We aimed at conducting field tests with the patients. However, due to time constraints as well as the complexity of reaching them in the hospitals, we performed our evaluations with three other representative users: an experienced stroke nurse and two stroke patients from Germany</p>
            <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
            <p>For the CHI 2016 Design Competition we had to deliver a paper, a poster and a video. In the paper we were asked to describe the proper and refer to previous works. The poster and the video were illustrations of the product we developed in this four weeks.</p>
            <p>This project showed me it is extremely challenging to reach patients in the spam of four weeks. I did not have contacts to stroke patients and performing remote evaluations is not ideal. My first lesson was that I need to have enough time to go through the process of contacting patients. Second, it is very important to keep in mind their condition and if they are too vulnerable, it is not ideal to disturb them with interviews.</p>

            <h4><mark> Context</mark></h4>
            <p>This project was part of the coursework for the Human-computer Interaction: Principles and Design (IC1007) course at KTH. I was working in a group with three other students and we were given the task of researching the needs of personal trainers, then designing an interactive, screen-based prototype. The final products were a PowerPoint prototype and a report describing the user tests we conducted.</p>
            <h4><mark> Process</mark></h4>
            <p>In order to identify the needs of personal trainers, we did some secondary research and semi-structured interviews with two employees at the university gym (KTH Halen). We identified two main issues they were facing at that moment: to keep track of the progress of each client and to advertise their services to a broader audience.</p>
            <p>Based on these findings we split the team in two group, then we brainstormed and sketched a solution for these problems. We made a paper prototype (low fidelity) to communicate our ideas in a clearer way to the rest of the team. After presenting our ideas, we decided to focus on a gamification solution for recording the improvements of the personal trainer's clients.</p>
            <p>Then, we built a high fidelity prototype using PowerPoint, as the brief given to our course required the use of this platform. We took this prototype to the field and we tested it using the Think Aloud method, in three different gyms around Stockholm. We found that many aspects of the design were not clear to the user and we wrote a report with suggestions to improve the interface. </p>
            <h4><mark> Outcome</mark></h4>
            <p>It was crucial to have the test planned beforehand. Specially because we wanted to gain the trust of the user and we wanted to demonstrated we were confident on what we were doing. We ran pilot tests which also helped us to correct potential mistakes before the actual test. We switched roles so that we could practice both, however, we did not switch in the middle of the test, so that the user was not confused.</p>
            <p>There are some limitations when using PowerPoint as a prototyping tool. One of them is that it takes a lot of time to add the links to the next slides, in order to make a clickable prototype. Another is the lack of wireframe icons, such as buttons and navigation arrows. We therefore had to create every item manually, which made the prototype look less similar to a real interface.</p>
            <p>In terms of testing the prototype, it is not always easy to explain the Think Aloud method to the users. In all the tests, we had to probe them, by directly asking what they are thinking, in order to get some data. Otherwise they just keep quiet or they just ask a question when they are stuck. For the next projects, it might be a good idea to show them an example, by conducting the test with my team member. By seeing a practical example, they might understand better what is expected from the test.</p>
